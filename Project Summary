# 🧠 NAPALM Network Automation Lab

This project demonstrates how I used **Python** and the **NAPALM (Network Automation and Programmability Abstraction Layer Multivendor)** library to automate basic network management tasks on Cisco IOS routers.

## 🚀 Project Overview
The goal of this lab was to learn how to automate network devices using Python instead of configuring them manually from the CLI.  
I built a small test topology with two Cisco routers (R1 and R2) connected in Packet Tracer and used NAPALM scripts from my PC to connect, collect data, and manage them over SSH.

Even though Packet Tracer doesn’t allow direct SSH from the host machine, this project shows the complete workflow and scripts that would work in a real environment (for example, GNS3, EVE-NG, or physical routers).

## 🔧 What the Script Does

- Connects to a Cisco router over SSH using NAPALM.  
- Retrieves **device facts** such as hostname, model, OS version, and uptime.  
- Can be extended to back up running configurations or push configuration changes.  
- Demonstrates structured data collection and clean session handling using Python.

## 🧩 Technologies Used
- **Python 3**
- **NAPALM** library (`pip install napalm`)
- **Cisco IOS routers** (tested on Packet Tracer)
- **Git & GitHub** for version control
